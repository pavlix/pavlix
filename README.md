### Pavel Å imerda

Freelance software developer. Rust enthusiast and haskell learner. Working with embedded operating systems and network devices. Astounded by eBPF debugging and performance profiling in Linux. Training anyone from young children to senior developers.

I used to be a full-time remote developer for Red Hat where I was the first person to drive the necessary change to make NetworkManager less painful on servers and virtual hosts. I got myself involved in IPv6 and DNSSEC efforts and in community efforts to make things work well across Linux distributions. Now I mostly work with smaller companies to get their products more easily integrated in embedded Linux systems.

In the upcoming years I am going to work with embedded software companies that understand the value of safe programming and consider switching from C and C++ to Rust. At the same time I can still provide support for C and C++ developers as I did before.
